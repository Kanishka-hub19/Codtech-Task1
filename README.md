## Overview of the Project

### Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Telco Customer Churn Dataset

### Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Telco's customer churn dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to understand the characteristics of customers who leave the service and derive actionable insights to reduce churn.

#### **Key Insights from EDA:**

1. **Customer Churn Overview:**
   - **Churn Rate**: 26.54% of the customer base has churned, posing a challenge for retention efforts.

2. **Demographics & Churn:**
   - **Senior Citizens**: Churn rate is 42%, significantly higher compared to 22% for younger customers.
   - **Action**: Tailored service packages and better support are required for older customers.

3. **Tenure & Retention:**
   - **Churn within 1-2 months**: Around 60% of churn occurs during the first two months.
   - **Retention after 1 year**: Churn drops to below 10%.
   - **Action**: Focus on improving onboarding and early engagement to retain new customers.

4. **Contract Type & Churn:**
   - **Month-to-Month Contracts**: These show the highest churn rate at 43%.
   - **Two-Year Contracts**: These show only a 3% churn rate.
   - **Action**: Promote long-term contracts with incentives to reduce churn.

5. **Service Usage & Retention:**
   - Customers using **bundled services** like PhoneService, InternetService (DSL), and OnlineSecurity have lower churn rates.
   - **Action**: Promote bundled service packages to increase customer retention.

6. **Payment Methods & Churn:**
   - **Electronic Check**: Users show a 40% churn rate, compared to around 10-15% for customers paying via credit cards or bank transfers.
   - **Action**: Encourage customers to use simpler and more reliable payment methods by offering incentives.

#### **Visualization Tools Used:**
- **Histograms** to visualize data distribution and key attributes.
- **Stacked Bar Charts** to compare churn rates across different demographic groups (e.g., age, tenure).
- **Bar Charts** to explore service usage and churn by contract type and payment method.
- **Subplots** for comprehensive comparisons of multiple variables (e.g., gender, seniority, and service usage) in a single view.

#### **Key Recommendations:**
1. **Enhance Early Engagement**: Implement a robust onboarding program to reduce churn in the first few months.
2. **Promote Long-Term Contracts**: Offer discounts and rewards for customers who commit to longer contracts.
3. **Increase Service Bundling**: Provide incentives for customers to adopt multiple services, reducing the likelihood of churn.
4. **Improve Payment Processes**: Encourage smoother payment methods to reduce churn caused by payment friction.

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer churn patterns, offering data-driven strategies for improving customer retention and business growth.
